# Privacy Policy
This privacy policy only refers to the Discord bots `Wiki-Bot#2998` (ID:&nbsp;`461189216198590464`) and `Wiki-Bot (Test)#4262` (ID:&nbsp;`432468082175246351`).

## Private data
The bot does not collect, save or share any private data.

## Other data
The bot needs to collect and save some data in order to function properly:
* **Wiki Accounts**: Wiki accounts connected using [OAuth2](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OAuth) are saved for easier verification. Using the [Dashboard](https://settings.wikibot.de/user), users can disconnect their accounts again or disable saving the connection completely.
* **Settings**: Modified guild settings are saved as long as the bot is a member of that guild and deleted shortly after the bot leaves the guild.
* **Supporters**: The bot maintains a list of translators and [Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/WikiBot) to provide some extra functionality for them.
* **Commands**: Commands are logged together with the guild id or user id for up to one week for debugging purposes.

The bot does not share any data with third parties.
